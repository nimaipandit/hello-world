# hello-world
The time-honored "hello world" programming introduction!
Welcome to the wonderful world of magical coding. Magic is real but it's also real hard work. Magic happens by itself but there is also an object and recipient of magic. Without one or the other Magic is not real. 

My name is DJ and I'm not magical or anything but I know someone who is.
